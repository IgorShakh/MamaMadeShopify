Growing toddlers also need a good balance of macronutrients - proteins, fats and carbohydrates. As carbs are the preferred fuel for active brains and muscles, including gluten containing pasta can optimise growth and development. We've also tasted more recipes than we can count and found that switching to gluten containing pasta was by far-falle the best texture-wise. Never fear, you'll still have plenty of gluten-free options available. <br\/><br\/><strong>Allergy advice<\/strong> - please be aware that our kitchen now handles <strong>gluten<\/strong>.
