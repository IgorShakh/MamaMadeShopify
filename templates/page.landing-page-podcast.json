But in reality, that’s easier said than done, not just for me but for most modern-day parents.<\/p><p>I was desperate for a bit of support; the juggling act of parenting can be challenging. Most days, I was out of time, overworked and lacked creativity during mealtimes, but I wasn't willing to compromise on my daughter's health or development. So, I set out to create a product for parents like me! And that's how Mamamade was born...<\/p>",
