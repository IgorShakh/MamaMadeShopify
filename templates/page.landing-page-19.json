In fact, it can take up to 20 tries of something before a baby learns a new taste. Mamamade has the most variety of any baby food delivery service, and our chefs are constantly working to release more. So whilst we encourage repeated exposure and a bit of patience, if there's something your baby truly doesn't like, we can change it up whilst keeping things interesting for both of you! <\/p>"
